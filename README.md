# Roadmap-DSA - 
All the core concepts regarding Data Structures and algorithms and Interview Questions are actively added from various sources in Java, C, C++, Typescript, and Go language.
The main focus is on the JAVA.
## Why Java?
Java is a write-once-run-anywhere language, it is a statically typed compiled language used in all the major systems and applications.
Many companies all across the industry therefore require Java and that's why the DSA concepts in Java are very crucial.
For basics of Java - https://github.com/ATLAS-B28/java-tut.
For CtCI library and questions refer to the original - https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition/tree/master.
It is used to learn and practice the questions in the book - CtCI.
Also, it has the CtCI library which is not mine.

Currently, Doing -
1. CtCI and LeetCode questions underway.
2. DP will be implemented soon
3. Also preparing using coding interview patterns - https://github.com/ATLAS-B28/interview_patterns .The original is -https://dvpr.gitbook.io/coding-interview-patterns/

## Why Go?
GO language started as an internal language at GOOGLE for their server code and now is rapidly gaining ground in the industry. GO has very simple syntax but 
has a very C/C++-like execution speed and can do concurrency and garbage collection. Therefore, learning DSA concepts in GO is very helpful.

## Why C/C++ ?
C/C++ languages have been used for a long time and will teach us to manage memory and concurrency. Also, it has the STL in-built which enables us to use various parts like containers. Useful to program complex and fast systems, here are often used in DSA.

## Why Typescript? 
Typescript is built upon Javascript and adds a type system to it. 
The Kata-Machine library is from ThePrimegean and not mine and will be used for his course on DSA.

## Why Python?
Python language is versatile and has easy to understand syntax.

## Why Scala?
Scala is JVM functional language. 

## Languages Used -
